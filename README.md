# How to use
<p>
Application to see a recent score from some player in the game osu!. It shows details that are not shown in the game website, but are shown in the API. Currently working only for osu!mania.
</p>

<p>UPDATE: I needed to set the limit for recent scores to 20, due to API ratelimit. </p>

<p>For using this application, it's that easy: You just open the .exe and insert the player username that you want to see recent plays, and it will show some details.</p>
